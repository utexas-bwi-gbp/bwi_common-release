ros-indigo-bwi-mapper (0.3.0-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * fix many catkin lint errors
  * indigo: fix opencv2 dependencies (#10 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/bwi_common/issues/10>)
  * much improved implementation. probably still need to do better.
  * added a path finder class for finding an obstacle free path in a map. It is now used by the logical navigation code
    to determine which approach point to use when approaching a door.
  * updated the code to separate drawing an arrow in the image vs drawing an arrow using the graph
  * enabled some globbing and made one of the cpp functions slightly faster.
