ros-indigo-bwi-rqt-plugins (0.3.3-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * fix catkin warning about bwi_rqt_plugins headers
  * wrap buttons around if too many.
  * switched controls from qshortcut to key press/release events for faster response time.
  * fixed image_view plugin to use settings for image topic name, since rqt cpp plugins don't support ros parametrization.
  * adding a separate package for bwi_rqt_plugins.
